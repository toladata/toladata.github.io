## Software and Service Combined.

The Tola advisors are experts in ICT and M&E and can be used remotely or in-person to help teams define their specific use cases and requirements for data collection, analysis and sharing. This will provide feedback into customizing the open tools in the Tola system allowing each program’s unique circumstances to be met, while at the same time retaining the same open source core and open data strategies allowing for easier collaboration and aggregation where it provides the greatest benefit.

The combination of these tools and services provide not just a verifiable set of data but a transferable learning experience to help individual programs and countries adapt and grow whilst sharing information to stakeholders across the globe.
